;; Item response theory (IRT)

;; Also known as latent trait theory, strong true score theory, or modern mental test theory, is a paradigm for the design, analysis, and scoring of tests, questionnaires, and similar instruments measuring abilities, attitudes, or other variables. Unlike simpler alternatives for creating scales evaluating questionnaire responses it does not assume that each item is equally difficult.
